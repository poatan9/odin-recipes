    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 pound dried ziti pasta</ul>
    <ul>1 onion, chopped</ul>
    <ul>1 pound lean ground beef</ul>
    <ul>2 jars spaghetti sauce</ul>
    <ul>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</ul>
    <ul>1 Â½ cups sour cream</ul>
    <ul>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</ol>
    <ol>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.</ol>
